# kvkapiR

The goal of kvkapiR is to provides a convenient interface to the Dutch
Chamber of Commerce (KvK) API. This package is built using the `httr2`
package and follows best practices for wrapping APIs in R, as outlined
in the httr2 documentation
(<https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/wrapping-apis.html>). It simplifies
authentication, request handling, and response parsing when interacting
with the KvK API.

## Installation

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
