\usage{
kvk_usage_report(format = "summary", year = NULL, month = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{format}{Character string specifying output format:
\itemize{
\item \code{"summary"} (default): Human-readable console output with
costs and call counts
\item \code{"tibble"}: Monthly aggregated data as a tibble, one row per month
\item \code{"tidy"}: Detailed data with one row per API call, suitable
for analysis and visualization
}}

\item{year}{Integer year to filter results (e.g., 2025). If NULL, shows all years.}

\item{month}{Integer month (1-12) to filter results. Only used when year is also specified.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{format = "summary"}: Invisible NULL (output printed to console)
\item \code{format = "tibble"}: A tibble with monthly usage summary
\item \code{format = "tidy"}: A tibble with detailed call-by-call data
}
}
\description{
Display or return API usage statistics and costs in various formats.
This function helps you monitor your KvK API usage and associated costs.
}
\details{
The summary format displays:
\itemize{
\item API call counts by type (search calls are free)
\item Cost breakdown including monthly base fee (EUR 6.20) and query costs (EUR 0.02 per profile call)
\item Total costs and number of active months
}

The tibble format provides monthly aggregated data suitable for reporting and analysis.
The tidy format provides raw call data perfect for creating custom visualizations.

Only production API calls are included in reports. Test environment calls are not tracked or reported.
