\title{Convert a nested list to a tibble}
\usage{
list_to_tibble(lst)
}
\arguments{
\item{lst}{A named list to be converted into a tibble.}
}
\value{
A tibble where each element of the list is represented as a column.
Nested lists with uniform atomic elements are converted into tibbles, while
other lists are stored as list-columns.
}
\description{
This function takes a nested list and converts it into a tibble. Each element
of the list becomes a separate column in the tibble. If a nested list
contains atomic elements of equal length, it is transformed into a tibble.
Otherwise, it is stored as a list-column.
}

    list(street = "Main St", number = 1),
    list(street = "Second St", number = 2)
