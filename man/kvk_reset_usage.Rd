\title{Reset usage tracking data}
\usage{
kvk_reset_usage()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. The function is called for its side effect
of deleting the usage data file.
}
\description{
Permanently delete all stored API usage data. This action cannot be undone
and will clear your entire usage history including call counts, timestamps,
and cost calculations.
}
\details{
This function removes the usage tracking file from your user data directory.
After reset:
\itemize{
\item All usage history is permanently deleted
\item \code{\link{kvk_usage_report}} will show no data
\item Cost calculations will restart from zero
\item Usage alerts will use the new baseline
}

The function only affects stored usage data. It does not change:
\itemize{
\item Usage alert settings (these are stored in R options)
\item API key configuration
\item Package preferences
}

This can be useful for:
\itemize{
\item Starting fresh tracking after a billing period
\item Clearing test data before production use
\item Privacy reasons when sharing a computer
\item Troubleshooting usage tracking issues
}
}
\examples{
\dontshow{if (interactive()) (if (getRversion() >= "3.4") withAutoprint else force)(\{ # examplesIf}
# Clear all usage history
kvk_reset_usage()

# Verify reset worked
kvk_usage_report()  # Should show "No usage data found"

# Usage tracking will restart with new API calls
results <- kvk_search(plaats = "Amsterdam")
kvk_usage_report()  # Will show the new call
\dontshow{\}) # examplesIf}
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{kvk_usage_report}} for viewing current usage,
\code{\link{kvk_export_usage}} for backing up data before reset,
\code{\link{kvk_usage_alert}} for setting usage limits
