\usage{
kvk_export_usage(file_path, format = "tidy")
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Character string specifying the path where the CSV file
should be saved. Can include relative or absolute paths. The file will
be created if it doesn't exist, or overwritten if it does.}

\item{format}{Character string specifying the export format:
\itemize{
\item \code{"tidy"} (default): One row per API call with detailed information
including timestamp, date, call type, and other metadata. Perfect for
creating custom visualizations and detailed analysis.
\item \code{"monthly"}: Aggregated monthly summary with call counts by type
and cost calculations. Ideal for reporting and budget tracking.
}}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. The function is called for its side effect
of creating a CSV file.
}
\description{
Export your KvK API usage data to a CSV file for external analysis,
reporting, or record keeping. Choose between detailed call-by-call data
or monthly aggregated summaries.
}
\details{
The exported data only includes production API calls. Test environment calls
are not included in the export.

\strong{Tidy format} includes these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{timestamp}: Exact time of the API call
\item \code{date}: Date of the API call
\item \code{year}, \code{month}: Extracted date components
\item \code{call_type}: Type of API call (search, basisprofiel, etc.)
\item \code{test_environment}: Always FALSE for production calls
}

\strong{Monthly format} includes these columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Year}, \code{Month}: Time period
\item \code{Search}, \code{Basisprofiel}, \code{Vestiging}, \code{Naamgeving}: Call counts by type
\item \code{Costs (EUR)}: Total costs including base fee and query charges
}
