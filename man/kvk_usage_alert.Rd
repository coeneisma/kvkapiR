\title{Set usage and cost alerts}
\usage{
kvk_usage_alert(max_calls = NULL, max_cost = NULL, period = "month")
}
\arguments{
\item{max_calls}{Integer maximum number of API calls before triggering alerts.
When reached, you'll see a danger alert. Continued usage beyond this limit
will show reminder warnings.}

\item{max_cost}{Numeric or character maximum cost before triggering alerts.
Can be specified as a number (e.g., 25) or string (e.g., "EUR 25").
Costs include both the monthly base fee (EUR 6.20) and per-query charges (EUR 0.02).}

\item{period}{Character string specifying the alert period:
\itemize{
\item \code{"month"} (default): Monitor usage within each calendar month
\item \code{"year"}: Monitor usage within each calendar year
\item \code{"total"}: Monitor cumulative usage across all time
}}
}
\description{
Configure automatic alerts to monitor your KvK API usage and prevent
unexpected costs. Alerts are triggered in real-time when you exceed
the specified limits during API calls.
}
\details{
Usage alerts help you stay within budget and monitor API consumption patterns.
When limits are exceeded, the package displays informative messages:

\itemize{
\item \strong{First alert}: Danger alert when the limit is first reached
\item \strong{Reminder alerts}: Warning messages for continued usage over limits
}

Alert settings are stored in R options for the current session and will apply
to all subsequent API calls. You must specify at least one of \code{max_calls}
or \code{max_cost}.

Only production API calls count towards limits. Test environment calls are ignored.
